# MtcdTools
Use this application to control your favorite music player using device hard keys or steering wheel keys.

Using MtcdTools you are able to bind your device hard keys to android NEXT/PREV/TOGGLE PLAY or make an shortcut and launch any application you want by simply press of previously bound button.

## Features:
# No root privileges are required
# Launch on startup
# Bind any device key or steering wheel key to NEXT/PREV/TOGGLE PLAY action
# Bind any device key or steering wheel key to Launch any application
# Create custom MODE applications list (does not override original one)

In order to make MtcdTools work, first you need to bind your key to the specific action. Use "Create a new binding" button, select one of available actions (NEXT/PREV/TOGGLE PLAY or LAUNCH), obtain key code and save the binding.

If you want to remove created binding, go to "Edit existing bindings" and long press on binding that you want to remove.

Application has been tested on MTCD GS 1.61 device but it should work also for other vendors.

Spotify, Poweramp and Google Play Music players have been tested with MtcdTools. Application is using the most common way to control music players so I am expecting it should work for other music players as well. Just test and share your feedback.
